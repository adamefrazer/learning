daily log of what I am learning

Day 11: April 5, 2018
-watched videos on CSS on Lynda.com. Learned about floats, positioning, and CSS layouts. 
-practiced on CodePen with floats

Thoughts:
feeling pretty good about this stuff. Seems mostly straight forward. I am concerned the videos I'm watching are outdated as they are dated 2012. Hopefully that isn't an issue.
