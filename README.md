# 100daysofcode

Day 25: (Dec 4th): Began creating a new portfolio page. It is similar to the layout of the Anchorhead coffee page I made. I really like the flexboxgrid framework(?). It is pretty simple to use. Next, I need to build a new website with a different layout to practice with it. I will build the Houston Texans season ticket page. 

Day 24: (3rd): Completed exercise 2 and 3 from chapter 3 of Eloquent javascript. Recursion and another function problem. Ex 2 I had to look at hints and ultimately the answer. Watched some videos on recursion along the way. But I figured out ex 3 all by myself so I was pretty proud of myself!

Day 23: (Dec 2nd): I did some coding on the 1st. Worked on Rule 35 website some. But, today I built a new website from this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlA7dputiNc&t=200s. This was sort of a spur of the moment project but I like the way it turned out. I am in a bit of a tutorial purgatory right now. Scared to work on JS and I am stuck between knowing enough tools to make websites on my own but then not enough to put all the pieces together to get a working project. I'm not sure about where to go from here. The websites I have made by following these tutorials look good but they are simple (which is good too) but I don't know that I'm learning anything. I think I am. I want to redo my portfolio website and then include these two projects on there to showcase them. I feel good about what I have done but I also feel it is pretty simple. Not sure.

Day 22: (Nov 30th): finished up a few things on Rule 35 website. Added some media queries for desktop screens. It was created as mobile first site. Added navigation but took it off for now because the 'about' and 'blog' pages are not created yet. That will be what I work on next after getting the landing page live online.

Day 21: (Nov 29th): totally redid my Rule 35 website. The basics are complete. Need to add a nav and some other items. I really like the layout much better and it is much more simple. I followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsEnj-1hG2o 

Day 20: (Nov 28th): read chapter 3 of Eloquent JavaScript and completed the first exercise. Learned about closures, writing functions that don't repeat themselves, recursion, and scoping. I thiiink I get it but I will definitely go back and review it all tomorrow night, reread it and complete the exercises then move on to chapter 4.

Day 19: (Nov 27th): got through chapter 2 of Eloquent JavaScript with Tom's help. He helped me figure out the loop insinde a loop problem (#3). Just got back from Hawaii yesterday and didn't do any coding over the Thanksgiving break. I did listen to CodeNewbie podcasts and read a tad of Eloquent JavaScript chapter 3. It was all review but I'm sure once I get to the exercises they will be tough!

Day 15: (Nov 15th): worked through first 2 exercises in chapter 2 of Eloquent JavaScript. Solved them on my one without much help or peeking at solution. Pretty proud of myself! Although I had solved them some months ago, I didn't remember how to do it. The next one looks tough and I really don't remember how to do it but I'm going to conquer it tomorrow. I need to stay Rhino focused on this book. I want to complete it!

Day 14: (November 14th): Another beginning of 100 Days of Code. I'm into 14 days now! Although, my new personal rules is even if I miss a day I am not restarting the count. I am 14 work days in now. I have been working on a portfolio site, my Rule 35 site (it is currently spaghetti code), Learn Enough Command Line to be dangerous and getting back into JavaScript. I am going to go through the Eloquent JavaScript book. Today and yesterday I began the first couple chapters. Today I got through Chapter 1 the types chapter. I tried to go through this book before and got stumped at the end of chapter 2. I will attempt again with a different spin, 'there is no try, there is only do'. I am going to do it. 

I will log everyday on this. Some days I feel like I accomplish a lot and others I feel like I spin my wheels. Today I feel indiferent. Got a late start and then got tired. I have lots of dreams and aspirations and interests and it is hard to stay focused. 

daily log of what I am learning

Ok it's real this time. I started my count over. I have completed 7 days. The first 5 days I worked through basic javascript challenges on freeCodeCamp and yesterday and today I began working though Gordon Zhu's Watch and Code. It has been a great resource. He explains things very straight forward and simply. I am really enjoying his resource and teaching style. I shall continue!

Day 1: May 15, 2018

Starting the count over. Been working with The Odin Project all this week. Working on the first project which is to build the google homepage. Almost have it done. Can't figure out the git the and how to send my work to my repository. I guess I need to go back through that.
Spent more time on it and I figured it out! Don't know how much I'll use it at this point but I figured it out and I'm proud of that!

Day 15: April 9, 2018
-found 'HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites' online pdf for free! Spent some time this morning flipping through it and using it as a reinforcer for other similar modes of learning.

Thoughts:
I am slowly learning this. I am ok with it. "A river cuts through rock, not because of its power, but because of its persistence."

Day 14: April 8, 2018
-continuing to practice with HTML and CSS with grids and columns, and playing with layouts.

Day 13: April 7, 2018
-got in a couple hours today. At least 1. Watched videos and practiced on codepen. Still on the same CSS stuff. I want to make a mock up website soon with what I have learned. Maybe that is what I'll do tomorrow. Although this stuff is still kinda foggy to me

Thoughts:
still learning about this stuff 

Day 12: April 6, 2018
-I maybe barely got a full hour in. I watched videos and practiced with CSS grid and flexbox during classes

Thoughts:
I feel like I am learning this. I don't know how long I'm supposed to stay on one subject. I've been working on this for a few days now and I don't know when I should be ready to move on

Day 11: April 5, 2018
-watched videos on CSS on Lynda.com. Learned about floats, positioning, and CSS layouts. 
-practiced on CodePen with floats

Thoughts:
feeling pretty good about this stuff. Seems mostly straight forward. I am concerned the videos I'm watching are outdated as they are dated 2012. Hopefully that isn't an issue.
