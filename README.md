daily log of what I am learning

Day 15: April 9, 2018
-found 'HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites' online pdf for free! Spent some time this morning flipping through it and using it as a reinforcer for other similar modes of learning.

Thoughts:
I am slowly learning this. I am ok with it. "A river cuts through rock, not because of its power, but because of its persistence."

Day 14: April 8, 2018
-continuing to practice with HTML and CSS with grids and columns, and playing with layouts.

Day 13: April 7, 2018
-got in a couple hours today. At least 1. Watched videos and practiced on codepen. Still on the same CSS stuff. I want to make a mock up website soon with what I have learned. Maybe that is what I'll do tomorrow. Although this stuff is still kinda foggy to me

Thoughts:
still learning about this stuff 

Day 12: April 6, 2018
-I maybe barely got a full hour in. I watched videos and practiced with CSS grid and flexbox during classes

Thoughts:
I feel like I am learning this. I don't know how long I'm supposed to stay on one subject. I've been working on this for a few days now and I don't know when I should be ready to move on

Day 11: April 5, 2018
-watched videos on CSS on Lynda.com. Learned about floats, positioning, and CSS layouts. 
-practiced on CodePen with floats

Thoughts:
feeling pretty good about this stuff. Seems mostly straight forward. I am concerned the videos I'm watching are outdated as they are dated 2012. Hopefully that isn't an issue.
